# FINAL PROJECT
## Getting and cleaning data
## README
This Dataset is generated by running the "run_analysis.R" script, to properly work the original dataset must be downloaded and unzipped in the working directory, the directory with the original dataset must be named as "UCI HAR Dataset" (it happen automatically if you simply unzip the original dataset in the working directory).

Generated dataset is composed by two files (.csv) derived from the original dataset from the following link: [Original data set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) 
The original dataset has information about measurements on 30 subjects that wear a celphone with acelerometers, there were three classes of states to be reconigzed:
- Walking
- Walking upstairs
- Walking downstairs
- Standing
- Laying
- Sitting

The variables measured by accelerometers were transformed in to 561 variables.
The original dataset was modified to obtain a file "DataSet1.csv" in which 79 variables were selected, only means and standard deviations of the original measurements.
The second available file is "DataSet2.csv" in which we summarise the average of each of 79 variables grouped by subject and activity.
